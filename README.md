This Python code can read your .vmr from which airplanes are there and replaces them with any airplanes you can define in your .txt.
The output then comes out formatted in a new vmr file.

1. Drag the .py in your ornder where you want it.
2. Your input.vmr which is to be scanned must be in this folder.
3. The Extended_Modelmatching.txt must also be in this folder.
4. The externaloutput.vmr must also be in this folder
5. Run the script.
